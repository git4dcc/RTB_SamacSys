Kicad Project Library

This library is required and referenced by all my RTB Kicad projects. The library just by itself has no use.<br><br>
The library was created using [SamacSys Library Loader](https://www.samacsys.com/).

# Usage
Please create the following directory structure,

```
<Directory>/SamacSys
<Directory>/<RTB_Project-1>
<Directory>/<RTB_Project-2>
...
<Directory>/<RTB_Project-N>
```
